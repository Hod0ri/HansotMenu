# HansotMenu
Toy Project using Only Python!


### Why?
While thinking about choosing a lunch menu faster and easier, I saw that I only eat lunch in "Hansot Lunch Box,"  
and I wanted to have a program to randomly select menus on the official site.  

### How?

GUI : using Tkinter
Back-End : using selenium, bs4...

### Design
